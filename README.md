- Full message filtering.
- Customisable event logging (including logging of message edits/deletions and moderator actions).
- Full infraction system to keep track of problematic users.
- Configurable command prefix.
- Intuitive command syntax.
- Anti-spam measures.
- Handy extra commands for changing user nicknames and avatars, getting information from a UUID, etc.
- WIP web interface for easy configuration.

## Documentation and Support

All of AutoMod's commands and features are [extensively documented](https://automod.vale.rocks/docs). If you still have questions or need help, you can join the [support server on Stoat](https://stt.gg/automod). The Stoat server is also a good way to stay in the loop on updates, changes, and development.

## Invite to Your Server

If you're on the official Stoat instance at [stoat.chat](https://stoat.chat) then you can [add AutoMod to your server](https://stoat.chat/bot/01FHGJ3NPP7XANQQH8C2BE44ZY). If you're on a third-party instance, then you'll need to host it yourself. Instructions to do so are available [in the docs on the website](https://automod.vale.rocks/docs/self-hosting).
