</div>
<br/>

AutoMod is [Revolt's](https://revolt.chat) premier moderation bot, featuring logging, filtering, utilities, anti-spam, comprehensive documentation, and much more. It aims to provide an easy way to protect your communities from malicious actors.

## Features

- Basic moderation commands, including kicking, warning, banning, and timing out users.
- Full message filtering.
- Customisable event logging (including logging of message edits/deletions and moderator actions).
- Full infraction system to keep track of problematic users.
- Configurable command prefix.
- Intuitive command syntax.
- Anti-spam measures.
- Handy extra commands for changing user nicknames and avatars, getting information from an ID, etc.
- WIP web interface for easy configuration.

## Documentation and Support

All of AutoMod's commands and features are extensively documented [on the wiki](https://github.com/DeclanChidlow/AutoMod/wiki). If you still have questions or need help, you can join the [support server on Revolt](https://rvlt.gg/automod). The Revolt server is also a good way to stay in the loop on updates, changes, and development.

## Invite to Your Server

If you're on the official Revolt instance at [revolt.chat](https://revolt.chat) then you can add AutoMod to your server with [this link](https://app.revolt.chat/bot/01FHGJ3NPP7XANQQH8C2BE44ZY). If you're on a third-party instance, then you'll need to host it yourself. Instructions to do so are available [on the wiki](https://github.com/DeclanChidlow/AutoMod/wiki/Self-Hosting).
